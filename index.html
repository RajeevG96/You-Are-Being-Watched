					<h3> <b>Why?</b> </h3>
					<p>Snowden uncovered evidence of unlawful agreements between these countries regarding the collection of intelligence collecition through spying on civilians.The UKUSA agreement was originally made in order to improve surveillance in the cold war however now it allows NSA, GCHQ and other organisations to share digital communication data from multiple nations.</p>                     <img id="flags" src="img/content/ukusa.jpg">

					<h3> <b>What does this mean?</b> </h3>
					<p>In response to the supposed terrorist attacks of 9/11 intelligence organisations built up a system of global surveillance capable of intercepting mass communications. This means that now more than ever your communications are able to be intercepted with no need for a warrant.</p> <img id="cctv" src="img/content/cctv.jpg">

					<h3> <b>Are you being watched?</b> </h3>
					<p>You may think that because you are not a terrorist you are not a subject of surveillance from these organisations - you are wrong. Even though you may have nothing to hide you are still unfortunately being watched due to intelligence agencies methods of mass surveillance. </p> <img id="spy" src="img/content/spying.jpg">
